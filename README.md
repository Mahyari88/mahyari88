# 🎯 Mahyar Abidi — Director of AI & Data Analytics

> Building data products that turn complexity into confident decisions.

---

## 💡 One-line

Industrial-engineer-turned-AI-generalist — I build pragmatic data platforms, BI products, and lightweight ML/LLM tooling for real business impact.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Create *Gradian Super App* — a single hub where teams access trustworthy, real-time insights, automate decisions, and ship data-driven products fast.

---

## 🔭 What I build (high-level)

* **Enterprise BI & EDW** — EDW design for complex holdings (4 sub-holdings × 10 subsidiaries each).
* **Data Platforms & Pipelines** — metadata-driven, scalable ETL/ELT with real-time and OLAP capabilities.
* **No/Low-Code analytics** — dashboards and tooling for non-technical decision makers.
* **Digital Twin & IoT** — telemetry, tracking (QR/NFC) and operational observability.
* **AI & LLM integrations** — lightweight LLM experiments, LangChain orchestration, vector stores for search.

---

## 🧭 Core values

* Simplicity over cleverness
* Production-first thinking
* Data observability and trust
* Fast iteration, low support burden
* Customer outcomes > vanity metrics

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap — what's next

1. Expand Gradian modules: Decision Hub → Real-time Alerts → Embedded LLM assistant
2. Harden EDW: monitoring, CI for ETL, OLAP cubes for finance & supply chain
3. Build lightweight LangChain examples and starter templates for teams

---

## 🤝 Collaboration — how we can work together

* I consult on BI platform architecture and implementation
* I build vendor-ready proposals and technical requirement analyses
* I mentor teams migrating from RDBMS to graph databases or adding LLM context to apps

If you're building something in pharma, life-sciences, or manufacturing — let's talk.

## 🎨 Design hints for a true infographic README

* Use a **hero banner SVG** at the top (headline + short tagline). SVG is crisp and themeable.
* Include **GitHub stat cards** (top languages, commit streak) and a small roadmap timeline image.
* Use consistent emoji icons and short, scannable text blocks.

---

## 🧾 Notes & privacy

* Remove or rotate any secrets (bot tokens, API keys) from public files. Consider storing them in environment variables or private repos.
